#### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent data science grad and former electrical engineer with 8+ years of technical and project experience. 

Throughout my career, I've worked to modernize industries that historically lacked the presence of software engineers and data scientists. 

It all started with physical clipboards and Excel files... ðŸ«  Since then, I've ventured into originating and harnessing data from emerging domains, such as electric vehicles and manufacturing processes.
