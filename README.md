#### Welcome! 👋

I'm a recent data science grad and former electrical engineer with 8+ years of technical and project experience. 

Throughout my career, I've worked to modernize industries that historically lacked the presence of software engineers and data scientists. 🚧🏭⚙

It all started with physical clipboards and Excel files... 🫠 Since then, I've ventured into originating and harnessing data from emerging domains, such as electric vehicles and manufacturing processes.
